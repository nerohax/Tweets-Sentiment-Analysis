# 💬 Twitter Tweets Sentiment Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **analyzing sentiment from Twitter tweets** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The goal is to classify tweets as **positive, negative, or neutral**, helping in understanding public opinion and trends.  

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
With millions of tweets generated daily, businesses and researchers need **automated sentiment analysis** to track opinions on products, services, and events. This project leverages **machine learning & deep learning techniques** to build a sentiment classification model.  

## 🚀 Approach  

### 1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing  
- Collected tweets using **Twitter API**.  
- Cleaned text by **removing stopwords, URLs, emojis, and special characters**.  
- Tokenized and converted text into numerical representation using **TF-IDF & Word Embeddings**.  

### 2️⃣ Model Development  
- Implemented **Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)** and **Deep Learning (LSTMs, BERT)** models.  
- Fine-tuned hyperparameters for better accuracy.  
- Used **pretrained embeddings (GloVe, Word2Vec)** for better text representation.  

### 3️⃣ Model Training & Optimization  
- Applied **cross-validation** to ensure robustness.  
- Used **Adam optimizer & learning rate scheduling** for optimal training.  
- Compared **ML vs. Deep Learning** models to select the best-performing one.  

### 4️⃣ Evaluation Metrics  
- **Accuracy:** `85%`  
- **Precision:** `0.82`  
- **Recall:** `0.80`  
- **Confusion Matrix & ROC Curve** used for model evaluation.  

## 📊 Results  
✅ Achieved **85% accuracy** on the test dataset.  
✅ Optimized NLP pipeline for **real-time sentiment classification**.  
✅ Built a **deployable sentiment analysis system**.
